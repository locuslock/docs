GRID is a mature C++ GNSS software suite (TRL 7) that is portable (desktop & embedded) and modular, featuring SDR techniques, with easy configuration and extensibility, scintillation-robust tracking loops, real-time and replay capabilities, and data bit wipe-off. Software can be deployed on multiple form factors. It can be tailored to static, desktop testing using a high performance Intel NUC or can be tailored to a smaller embedded form factor, such as an Odroid C4. Here is a list of recommended processors suitable for GNSS-SDR (not inclusive of all options).

  * `Odroid C4 <https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c4/>`_: These run about $55-85 each in low quantities.
  * `Intel NUC <https://www.amazon.com/Intel-13-NUC13ANHi5-Barebone-Bluetooth/dp/B0C1K3R4Q6/ref=sr_1_9?crid=3DDD4MAN0IFCC&keywords=intel%2Bnuc%2Bi4&qid=1691190023&sprefix=intel%2Bnuc%2Bi4%2Caps%2C127&sr=8-9&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18630bbb-fcbb-42f8-9767-857e17e03685&th=1>`_: These cost about ~$500-900 each in low quantities, depending on the RAM and storage needed.
