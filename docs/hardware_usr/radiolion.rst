RadioLion
=========

The RadioLion dual-antenna, triple-frequency RF Front-End receives, filters, amplifies, down-mixes, and digitizes the raw analog GNSS signals from the antenna(s) to produce a binary stream of intermediate-frequency samples that the receiver computer can process. The board also houses a Bosch BMI088 inertial measurement sensor (IMU).

Key Features
------------
  * Integrated digital radio & inertial measurement front-end designed for use with software-defined GNSS and GNSS-inertial fusion systems
  * Multi-constellation and multi-frequency heading and positioning solution
  * Streams RF data samples and IMU measurements to processor
  * Supports simultaneous capture from two antenna ''channels'' on three frequencies each via a total of six radio integrated circuits (ICs) and accompanying filter networks
  * Real time operation
  * USB connectivity with computer
  * Generates a configurable 1-pulse-per-second (PPS) output synchronized to GPS time: a valuable feature for sensor synchronization, vehicle coordination, and system integration
  * Small form factor for seamless product integration 
  * High accuracy clock oscillator (20 MHz)
  * Preconfigured for external or internal clock source (switching requires minimal rework)
  * Software-reconfigurable, high-rate data streaming at up to 196 Mbits per second
  * Flexible sampling rates
